## Trust cups is a tool which allows customers to lend the coffee and pay it back later.  It collects customer's transaction data and analysing their trust index.  After every time when customers buys a coffee, trust index is increasing, which means more trust cups. 
However if customer doesn't pay until deadline his trust index is decreasing and he is loosing opportunity to use credit option.

We offer 3 packs of memberships: Individual, Family and Company.

With an individual pack you can pay your credit over a month and send some trust cups to your friends.

Family membership allows kids to have their own account so responsible mother or dad shouldnâ€™t worry did they give pocket money or no.

And the last but not least Company membership! A lot of companies buys to their employees cards with benefits for exact amount of money, but imagine how much money company can save for spending just as much as employees used of course with the limits what you can control.
