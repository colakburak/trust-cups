## What is it and how it works?

Trust cups is a tool which allows customers to lend the coffee and pay it back later.  It collects customer's transaction data and analysing their trust index.  After every time when customers buys a coffee, trust index is increasing, which means more trust cups. 


## Why do we need this?

Trust Cups is a integration API for retail shops. With our BUY NOW PAY LATER key idea, we develop Hybrid Loyality Program. We believed the best way to increase loyality of customers is a both side trust. With our analysis we can get Trust Index for each customer.

## What is more?

However if customer doesn't pay until deadline his trust index is decreasing and he is loosing opportunity to use credit option.

We offer 3 packs of memberships: Individual, Family and Company.

With an individual pack you can pay your credit over a month and send some trust cups to your friends.

Family membership allows kids to have their own account so responsible mother or dad shouldnâ€™t worry did they give pocket money or no.

And the last but not least Company membership! A lot of companies buys to their employees cards with benefits for exact amount of money, but imagine how much money company can save for spending just as much as employees used of course with the limits what you can control.
